Version - 12nd March 2013 (2.0.5)
New feature added
1. Export properties Google Earth KML format
Export properties to Google Earth KML

2. Address format
Address format

3. Photo gallery
Slimbox photo gallery

4.  Reference ID
Customers told us, they want to have Property ID or Reference ID number for each property. Even they can use feature "extra fields" for their purpose, but almost of them don't like that way. Because, in extra field "property ID" isn't be shown in main position in property modification page, the field "property ID" can't be searched through input field "keyword" in search pages like advance search, locator search v.v. and the the extra field "property ID" can't be shown in the "random properties" module, properties list v.v. unless we modify source code.
In this version, we add one field into OS Property's attributes. It is called "ref"

5.  Price groups
In old version, OS Property only supports one type of price groups for all property types of OS Property system. It's really not good, because in fact, the price lists for properties of Sale type are different with the price lists for properties of Rent type v.v.
From this version, we modify the pricegroups feature. Remove display price, add price from, price to and property type fields for each price list item.

6. More power search function
As we mentioned in point 5, from version 2.0.5, we add property type into price list. With this feature, administrator can split the advance search form and locator search form by property types
To split the Advance and Locator search form by property types, administrator must configure it in Configuration > Search tab
If you select option All property types, the dropdown Property type will be appeared in the Advance/ Locator search page.
The same with search module

 7  Map overlay
Administrator can select default overlay for Google Maps in OS Property by go to Configuration > Tab General > Google maps

8. New modules layouts
We add bootstrap css to modules of OS Property like Random properties, Calculator, Mortgate modules.

9. Add change log into Control Panel of OS Property in backend side

10.  Issues fixed
# Search function in Advance search and locator search
# Expiration calculator
# Sef extension for Sh404sef
# Showing double yahoo icon in Agent details layout
# Remove slashes "\" in property details content of properties
# Adjust css of several layouts
# Search module and advance search are the same page
# Saving search list
# Manage companies's agents
# Change State's status in backend

Version - 25th February  2013 (2.0.4.6)
New bugs fixed
In old versions, administrator can't put the search module in the same page with the advance search page, because there are the conflict issues with the country, state and citi select lists in search module and advance search page. In this version (2.0.4.6), we have solved that bug. 
In this version, we also change the button class in OS Property form with bootstrap css.
Manual upgrade:
components > com_osproperty > classes > listing.php
components > com_osproperty > classes > listing.html.php
components > com_osproperty > classes > ajax.php
components > com_osproperty > js > ajax.js
You need to re-install the module mod_ospropertysearch to apply new changes for that module in your site.

Version - 18th February  2013 (2.0.4.4)
Add new function for watermark feature. 
In old versions, when you select to use watermark function for properties's photos, the pattern text (property type name) can be appeared in first photo of every properties. 
But in new version (2.0.4.4), you have more choice in Watermark feature.
In Configuration > Tab Image 
1. You can select to add watermark onto all photos of properties's photos
2. You can select position in the properties's photos that the watermark image or pattern will appear
3. You can select watermark type : Text pattern or Image
4. If you select watermark type is Text pattern, you can select the text is category name, property type name, business name (in Configuration panel) or Custom text (You can setup it)
5. If you select watermark type is Text pattern, you need  to select font size and color of the text pattern
6. If you select watermark type is Image,  you need to upload the watermark image.

7. Some customers ask us to remove the step "Customize thumbnail and medium photos" after click 'Save' or 'Apply' button at the toolbar. We think that's good idea, and we added it into this version. 
In the configuration, tab Image,  you can turn it off by uncheck the option "Making thumbnail and medium photos by manually"
8. We receive quite a lot requests from customers who ask us to let them know how to change the default view of the properties list. In this version, we add the option in the Configuration > Tab Properties > List view setting > Select default view, it allows administrator to select the default list view in the frontend of OS Property.

All above features are applied to both frontend and backend.
